- object-fit:The object-fit CSS property sets
    how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, 
    should be resized to fit its container.
    object-fit: fill;
    object-fit: cover;
    object-fit: none;
    object-fit: contain;
    object-fit: scale-down;


- A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
    There are four different combinators in CSS:
        descendant selector (space)
        child selector (>)
        adjacent sibling selector (+)
        general sibling selector (~)
    -Child Selector (>)
        The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.
        The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:
        div > p {
            background-color: yellow;
            }
    -Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
        The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
        Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
        The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements
        div + p {
            background-color: yellow;
            }
    -General Sibling Selector (~)
        The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
        The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements:
        Example
        div ~ p {
        background-color: yellow;
        }
